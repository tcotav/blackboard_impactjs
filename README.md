Blackboard Entity for impactJS

This is a simple rather limited means to draw text on the screen.  My game
requires text description during the tutorial phases so this was my
solution to that.

The limitations are primarily that the "writing" area is limited at design
time.  You have a fixed blackboard on which to write.  You input as a 
weltmeister parameter "text" containing your full text.  The entity will
reflow the text to fit the blackboard.
